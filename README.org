#+TITLE: Edge-disjoint K-shortest paths

* Description
This package contains an efficient implementation (C++) of the edge-disjoint K-shortest paths algorithm.
It comes with a python wrapper that allows to give the graph data through Numpy arrays.

The underlying C++ code is largely taken from [[https://fleuret.org/cgi-bin/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=mtp.git;a=summary][here]].

* Installation
We give here installation instructions applicable to Ubuntu/Debian-based distributions.

- Install requirements:

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    sudo apt install -y graphviz cmake
    #+END_SRC

- Clone repository along with the pybind11 sub-module

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:lejeunel/pyksp.git
    #+END_SRC

- Compile and install using your favorite package-manager, e.g.
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    cd pyksp
    pip install .
    #+END_SRC

* Usage
Go through the ~demo.py~ script to see how to interact with the module.
Most steps are commented therein.

* Example
A simple graph with 8 nodes and 13 edges gives the following set of 3 edge-disjoint shortest paths:
